## Traffic Flow Prediction Using LSTM

The objective of this project is to leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting traffic flow. The dataset used is sourced from the "IBB Açık Veri Portalı" Traffic Density Datasets, specifically focusing on Istanbul's location density and traffic information. The data is collected on an hourly basis, spanning from January 2020. For the purposes of this project, we are narrowing our focus to a three-month period—March, April, and May 2023.

Our approach involves extracting the average number of cars from various locations, aggregated on an hourly basis. By employing LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, we aim to forecast traffic flow patterns based on historical data. The ultimate goal is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the average number of cars during different hours, providing insights into traffic dynamics for the specified timeframe.
